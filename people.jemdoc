The P3 stands for PPP, a positioning technology which can achieve high-precision positioning without commercial base station. P3-LOAM[1] loosely couples PPP and LiDAR-SLAM with factor graph optimization. P3-LINS[2] tightly couples PPP/INS/LiDAR-SLAM with extended Kalman Filter. P3-VINS[3] tightly couples PPP/INS/Visual-SLAM with optimization method. PIEKF[4] stands for Partial Invariant Extended Kalman Filter and it is a kind of geometry filter which can maintain the filterâ€™s consistency.
